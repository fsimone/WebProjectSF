HOW TO INTEGRATE - Spring Boot 2.2 - Hibernate 5 - Postgres 12

The current project is for test purpose; it use maven3 ad git tools for integration.
Is possible to start this application like a Spring-Boot Application if the main method is decommented
otherwise is possible to run it as WAR into Tomcat 9 ( do not use Tomcat 8 with Postgres Diver because PostgresSQL 42.2.2 are not supported).

Select proper Application path in application.properties file, also Log4j.properties have a dedicated path that must be specified.
